# Describe Cloud Concepts (20-25%) 

## Identify the benefits and considerations of using cloud services 

- identify the benefits of cloud computing, such as High Availability, Scalability, Elasticity, Agility, and Disaster Recovery 

fault tolerance 

-  ability of a system to continue to function in the event of a failure of some of its components



- identify the differences between Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx) 
- describe the consumption-based model 

## Describe the differences between categories of cloud services 

- describe the shared responsibility model



![laas, paas, saas responsibility and control](https://stackify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/word-image-7-1024x550.png)

- describe Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), 
  - Compute
    - VMs / Servers
    - Azure virtual machines
  - Storage
  - Networking
  - ... any kinds of servers



- describe Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) 



### PaaS

- **doesn't provide full control** of OS that hosts applications
  - only IaaS provides this
- can scale platform automatically ✅ 
- has **pre-coded** application components built into the platform :white_check_mark:



Types of service in Azure that are PaaS 

- App service
  - Web App
  - Mobile App
  - Logic App
- Functions
- Web Jobs
- Azure SQL databases



- describe serverless computing 

  

- describe Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) 

you are responsible for Configuring the SaaS solution ✅



- identify a service type based on a use case

- identify a service type based on a use case 

## Describe the differences between types of cloud computing 

- define cloud computing 
- describe Public cloud 

mean no data center ✅

metered pricing ✅

self service management ✅

no dedicated hardware ✅

connections to public cloud are secure ✅ 

storage is not limited ✅ 



- describe Hybrid cloud 



- compare and contrast the three types of cloud computing
